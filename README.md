# Financial Engineering Portfolio Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on constructing an optimized financial portfolio using various technical strategies. The goal is to achieve a Sharpe ratio greater than any single instrument within the portfolio, leveraging historical price data from a range of financial instruments.

## Key Features
- Analysis of historical data spanning from 12/31/1999 to 12/31/2018.
- Portfolio includes equities, fixed income instruments, commodities, and currency pairs.
- Application of strategies like Moving Average Crossover (MA), Bollinger Bands (BB), and benchmarking (BMK).
- Implementation of optimization techniques to maximize the portfolio's Sharpe ratio.

## Data
The project utilizes close price data for:
- **Equities:** Technology, utility, and pharmaceutical companies, and a broad market ETF.
- **Fixed Income:** Investment grade bond and total bond market indices.
- **Commodities:** Broad commodity index and platinum.
- **Currencies:** Canadian Dollar and British Pound.

## Strategies Employed
- MA Crossover Strategy (flat and short)
- Bollinger Band Strategy
- Benchmark Strategy
Each strategy was applied to enhance the portfolio's performance.

## Analysis
- Correlation matrix calculation to understand interdependencies.
- Mean-Variance Optimization for determining optimal asset allocation.
- Monte Carlo simulation for exploring various portfolio compositions.

## Portfolio Construction
A diverse portfolio of eight chosen strategies was created, adhering to specific constraints and optimization parameters to achieve a high Sharpe ratio.

## Installation and Usage
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or an equivalent environment to run `.ipynb` files.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the notebook file.
